## MODEL:

Our model can simulate the thinking process of human beings by helping to solve a problem. Our AI 
model operates by simulating the cognitive processes of human reasoning to address the challenge of 
financial fraud within institutions it is an entirely artificial environment confined to the database and 
inscribed output on the screen. Our model utilizes the Decision Trees classifier, a powerful algorithm 
known for its effectiveness with extensive datasets.

Model Evaluation: To gauge the performance of our fraud detection model, we executed an evaluation 
procedure using the predict function with our test data. The key metric we employed to assess accuracy 
is the accuracy_score function, which provides insights into the model's precision.

The evaluation results yielded a binary series of outcomes, consisting of 0s and 1s, representing 
predicted values for distinguishing between legitimate financial aid applications and potentially 
fraudulent ones. Impressively, our Decision Trees classifier demonstrated a remarkable accuracy rate of 
95.05%.
